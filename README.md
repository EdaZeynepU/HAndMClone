# React Project

This is a kind of clone of H&M's homepage with typescript and MUI.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below.


### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/EdaZeynepU/HAndMClone
   ```

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:

   ```
   cd HAndM
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```
   yarn
   ```

### Development Server

To start the development server and view the application in your browser, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

or

```
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server and provide you with a development URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). Open this URL in your browser to see your React application in action.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

or

```
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized and minified bundle of your application in the `dist` directory.

### Deployment

The contents of the `dist` directory can be deployed to any static file hosting service or server of your choice.
